<p>

Prepare a list of custom motions that you need and we'll stream
the mocap data into your computer live. You can direct the actor in
real time to capture that perfect performance you need.  </p>

<p><em>PROs:</em> you are still in control of the shoot via Skype
or similar means. This is the most budget-friendly way of figuring out your ideas.</p>

<h3 class="clear">On-site mocap<img src="images/sample_actor.png" class="right last"></h3>

<p>

At your location: studio, set, office, football field, ski slope - you name it!  </p>

<p><em>PROs:</em> you can direct the session, you can use your
own actors and we can show you in real time what the actor does,
retargeted to your 3D character.</p>

<p>

Not every technology works well in variable lighing conditions
and exposed to the elements. We can come to your set or venue and make
your live event as interesting as it ever gets. Ask us for an online demo!</p>

<p>

We can lend a hand with retargeting the motions to your characters.</p>
